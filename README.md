# Starfield Simulation Component

This React component simulates a starfield, creating a visual representation of stars moving towards the viewer, similar to what you might see while traveling through space at high speeds.

## Features

- Dynamic generation of stars.
- Configurable star count, color, speed, and background.
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Customizable blend mode for creative visual effects.

## Installation

`npm i react-starfield@latest`

## Usage

You can use the Starfield component in your React application like any standard component. Import the `Starfield` into your component and include it in your render method or return statement.

```jsx
import Starfield from 'react-starfield';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Starfield
        starCount={1000}
        starColor={[255, 255, 255]}
        speedFactor={0.05}
        backgroundColor="black"
      />
      {/* Other components */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
